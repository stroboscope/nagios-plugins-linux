    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 16 and 17
    -- "400th (git) commit" release

-- Enhancements

* check_fc: new plugin for checking the status of the fiber channel
  ports.

-- Fixes

* Fix a resource leak in the library 'thresholds'.

* Minor fix in the library 'interrupt'.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 15 and 16
    -- "25 aprile" release

-- Enhancements

* check_cpufreq: new plugin.

* meminfo lib: reduce the memory footprint by not allocating the
  variable exported by /proc/memory and not used by any plugin.

* check_cpu: new option '--per-cpu' for checking the CPU utilization
  for each CPU.  A warning message is returned if at least one CPU
  exceeds the warning threshold and no CPU exceed the critical state.
  A critical message is returned if at least one CPU exceeds the
  critical threshold.
  The option '--cpufreq' has been removed because this information is
  now provided by the new plugin 'check_cpufreq'.

-- Fixes

* check_multipath: fix the regular expression that catches the failed
  paths and that prevented the plugin from working correctly.

* Improved code quality based on the Coverity scan analysis.

* Build system: minor fixes to make the Travis-CI Continuous
  Integration work - gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) environment.
  Update some obsolete macros used by configure.ac.
  Portability has been improved.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 14 and 15

-- Enhancements

* check_memory / meminfo lib: the command line option '-C|--caches'
  now does nothing but is still accepted for compatibility.
  The memory usage calculation has been reviewed and is now more
  accurate.  The changes are based on the (long) discussions and
  patches that have been recently posted in the procps mailing list.

* check_memory / meminfo lib: a fall-back has been implemented in
  order to provide the memory available counter for the linux kernels
  2.6.27 and above,

* check_cpu: add one decimal digit to the counters 'cpu_user',
  'cpu_system', 'cpu_idle', 'cpu_iowait', and 'cpu_steal'.

* check_cpu: new command line option '-m|--no-cpu-model' for removing
  the cpu model description from the output message.

                     -= Korbielow 2014 release =-

-- Enhancements

* check_users: new '--verbose' mode, for debugging.

* check_uptime: new option '-m|--clock-monotonic' for retrieving the
  time of the linux monotonic clock instead of using the system 
  statistics returned by 'sysinfo()'.

* New library 'xstrtol' containing the function 'strtol_or_err' that
  was previosly duplicated in several plugins.

-- Fixes

* check_clock: option '--refclock': validate the input instead of
  returning crap when the date format is unsupported.

* check_readonlys: do not dereference a null pointer string in the
  output message when no readonly filesystems are detected.

* Minor fixes.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 12 and 13

-- Enhancements

* The build system, the plugins and libraries are been reworked in
  order to support some older Linux kernels and (gcc) compilers.
  The "nagios-plugins-linux" can now be compiled and run on older
  linux systems, like RHEL 5 (gcc 4.1.2, kernel 2.6.18).

* check_memory: new option '-a|--available' for selecting the kernel
  counter 'MemAvailable' instead of the default one (memory used).
  This feature requires a Linux kernel 3.14 or better.
  For older kernels the plugin falls back to the free memory counter.

-- Fixes

* check_tcpcount: do not exit with 'error opening /proc/net/tcp6'
  when the command line option '--tcp6' has not been specified.

* cpustats library: do not exit with an error message if 'softirq'
  cannot be found in /proc/stat'. This entry is not provided by old
  kernels.

=====================================================================
    
    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 11 and 12

* New plugin 'check_intr'.
* meminfo library: get 'MemAvailable' value from /proc/meminfo
  (kernel 3.14+) for a future usage.

  'count' is 1.

======================================================================
